database restaurant

waiters
id
name str

menu_items
id
item_name str


(in mongo, we could store an arbitrarily long array of objects in each "order" document, and just have an orders collection, can't do that easily here)

item_orders(
	id
	menu_item_id
	waiter_id
	ticket_id --add this later
	notes text --"side of ranch"
	open boolean
)
the kitchen might like an /orders functionality

we might wanna see if a waiter has open orders:
waiter has many item orders
waiter has many menu items through item_orders

menu_item has many item orders
menu_item has many waiters through item_orders






tickets
id
table_no
shift_id
waiter_id
open 


shifts
id
date
lunch or dinner enum


ticket has many menu items
ticket has one waiter
ticket belongs to shift



waiter has many tickets
item_order belongs to ticket
ticket has one shift
